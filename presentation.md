Goodbye JavaScript ðŸ‘‹ Hello Rust: Exploring front-end development with yew.rs 

# Introduction
## Attention graber + greeting

SLIDO!!!

Have you ever built a web application?

Are you familiar with JavaScript?

How familiar are you with Rust?

Mention a fron-end framework! (Word-cloud)

Is it a good idea to use Rust for your web UI?

- No

Is it a good idea to use JavaScript for your web backend?

- Also no

## Topic
This presentation is about exploring front-end development in Rust...

Questions I would like to answer in this presentation are

- What are the benefits of building your frontend in Rust?
- When does it make sense to choose Rust for your frontend?

## About me
...Engineering Physics + Machine Learning
...Tobii, Norna, Klarna, Validio

Read the Rust book 2017, implemented AoC in Rust. Various side projects etc...

# Body

## Background
Let's talk a bit about my background in web development.

- Django (travel blog)
- Flask + React (Data cleaning tool)
- FastAPI + Elm UI (Data annotation tool)
- Rocket + Elm UI (Wedding web page)
- Actix Web + Yew.rs (Nutrition tracking tool, in progress...)

## What stack would I use today?

- Real conventional SPA application: Rust backend + TypeScript frontend (Validio)
- Real content-drivent application: Rust backend + tera templates (SSR)
- Small project: Full-stack Rust (Full-stack JS used to be king here)

## Important properties for smaller projects

- Ergonomics
- Hackability
- Single language, avoid repeating type definitions & logic
- Rich ecosystem of libraries

Let's start exploring!

## Minimal Yew.rs app
This is what you need to get started with Yew:

```

```

## Full-stack JS vs. full-stack Rust

- Rust is not the perfect fit for front-end development.

What's worse, having Rust in your front-end or JS in your backend?

# Conclusion

## Questions

## Conclusion/summary

Is it a good idea to use Rust for your web UI today?

- No

Will Rust become a viable language for web UIs in the future?

- No

But is it at least fun to write front-end Rust?

- Also no, but let's do it anyway ;)
